The place where Bibata's cursor gets personalized. This project is the successor to [Bibata_Cursor](https://github.com/ful1e5/Bibata_Cursor) and provides the easiest personalization of cursors, along with other options to create your own Bibata cursor.

## Bibata?

TLDR; This cursor set is a masterpiece of cursors available on the internet, hand-designed by [Abdulkaiz Khatri](https://github.com/ful1e5).

Bibata is an open-source, compact, and material designed cursor set that aims to improve the cursor experience for users. It is one of the most popular cursor sets in the Linux community and is now available for free on Windows as well, with multiple color and size options. Its goal is to offer personalized cursors to users.

### What does "Bibata" word mean?

The sweetest word I ever spoke was "BI-Buh," which, coincidentally, is also the word for peanuts. To make it more pronounceable and not sound like a baby's words, I added the suffix "Ta." And with that, my journey in the world of open-source began.

## Why a Download Limit?

Bibata, originally an open-source project, has evolved into a web application to improve accessibility. Developing cursors involves using serverless functions, incurring costs like compute expenses, hosting fees, maintenance for the Redis database, and other service charges. To offset these costs, I depend on sponsorships through the GitHub Sponsor program. By sponsoring me on a monthly basis, you'll enjoy benefits like unlimited downloads, early access to new features, and more.

Upon achieving my monthly sponsorship goal, the public download limit is lifted.

### Information on Downloads

-   **Pro:** Unlimited Downloads
-   **Fresh SignIn:** 20 Free Downloads
-   **Public Downloads:** Determined by (monthly sponsorship in cents x 3)

## How to Upgrade to a "Pro" Account?

To enjoy the perks of a "Pro" account, begin sponsoring [ful1e5](https://github.com/sponsors/ful1e5) at a **monthly tier**. Connect this sponsored GitHub account to the app to unlock pro features and enjoy unlimited downloads.

By doing so, you will not only gain access to pro features but also receive all the benefits listed on the sponsorship tier. Additionally, you have the opportunity to be featured with a shoutout in the download section and **contribute to increasing the public downloads factor**.
